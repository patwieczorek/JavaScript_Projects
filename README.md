Java Script Projects
These are some smallprojects I made using JavaScript, including:
*Pizza Menu (used to order pizza by selecting different options and submitting them. It then takes input and calculates the total price)
*Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Classic game which randomly rolls the dice to select whose turn it is and lets the players chose the tokens. Win is celebrated with a sound  and flashing line)
*Calculator (A basic 4 function calculator to perform mathematical equasions)
